# Burger MVC

A burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.

## How it works

* I WANT DA YUMMY BURGERZ! is an app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* The app stores every burger in a database, whether it's devoured or not.

* A user can add the name of a burger that they would like to devour OR one that they have already devoured.

* The app displays the BURGERZ NOT DEVOURED on the left side of the page and the BURGERZ DEVOURED on the right.

* Each burger on the left side has a `I HAS DEVOURED THIS ONE!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right column.

* Similarly, each burger on the right side has a `I WANTS DIS ONE AGAIN!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the left column.

* Also, there is a `__delete from list__` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will be removed from the list and the database.

## Example

* Whenever a burger is added, updated, or deleted in the web app, the database is updated as well.
